            <h1><b>About</b></h1>
            <p>I am a curious and driven individual who believes that growth begins with asking the right questions.</p><p>I am continuously learning, building, and refining my skills to create meaningful digital experiences.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I enjoy transforming ideas into structured, functional solutions whether it is developing a front-end interface, designing a user-friendly layout, or debugging a challenging issue, I find satisfaction in solving problems step by step. </p><p>I approach every project with attention to detail and a mindset focused on improvement. </p>
            <br>
            <p>For me, development is not just about writing code, it's about understanding logic, structure, and user experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on multiple projects that strengthened both my technical and analytical abilities. Building applications, designing responsive layouts, and implementing interactive features have helped me understand the importance of planning before execution. Each project has taught me something new.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Beyond technical skills, I believe in continuous learning. Technology evolves rapidly, and staying adaptable is essential. I actively explore new tools, frameworks, and trends to expand my understanding. I see challenges not as obstacles but as opportunities to grow stronger and more capable.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My long-term goal is to become a skilled and impactful developer who creates solutions that improve everyday experiences. I aspire to work on projects that challenge me intellectually and allow me to contribute to meaningful technological advancements. I am motivated not only by personal success but by the opportunity to build tools and platforms that make a difference.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I believe progress is built on consistency. Small improvements made daily lead to significant growth over time. With dedication, curiosity, and resilience, I continue to move forward by learning, building, and evolving with every step.</p>

            <h1><b>Projects</b></h1>
            <h3><b>1. RGB Color Recognition System</b></h3>
            <p>I developed an RGB color recognition system that detects whether an object placed in front of a camera is red, green, or blue. This project uses image processing techniques to analyze the color values captured through a live video feed.</p>
            <p>The goal of this project was to understand how digital images are processed and how color detection works at a pixel level. It strengthened my knowledge of color models, camera input handling, and real-time data processing.</p>
            <br>
            <h3><b>2. Image Gallery</b></h3>
            <p>I designed and developed a responsive image gallery that displays images in a structured and visually appealing layout. The gallery allows users to browse images smoothly, ensuring proper alignment and spacing across different screen sizes.</p>
            <p>This project helped me improve my front-end development skills, particularly in layout design, styling, and responsiveness. </p>
            <br>
            <h3><b>3. Calculator</b></h3>
            <p>I created a fully functional calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator processes user input dynamically and displays real-time results.</p>
            <p>This project enhanced my understanding of JavaScript logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation. I implemented input validation and structured the logic to ensure accurate mathematical operations.<p>
            <br>
            <h3><b>4. Music Playlist</b></h3>
            <p>I developed an interactive music playlist application with features such as play, pause, next, previous, progress tracking, and volume control. The player dynamically updates song details, album artwork, and duration while maintaining a smooth user interface.</p>
            <p>This project strengthened my knowledge of audio handling in JavaScript, event listeners, dynamic styling, and UI interactivity. I implemented progress bar synchronization and automatic song transitions to enhance user experience.</p>
            <p>Through this project, I gained practical experience in building an application that combines design, functionality, and real-time interaction.</p>
