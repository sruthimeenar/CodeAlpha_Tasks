# CodeAlpha_Tasks
This is a repository containing the projects that I created for my CodeAlpha internship. I made four projects:
1. Image Gallery - It contains ten images that can be sorted into two categories - scenery and nature. Clicking on the pictures allows expansion of picture. It contains lightbox view, and allows navigation between pictures.
2. Calculator - It is a basic calculator that has keyboard support and can handle basic mathematics.
3. Portfolio - It is my portfolio containing the projects I made and contact information. It also has a navigation bar.
4. Music Player - It is a music player that contains some of my favorite music and it allows auto-play and you can switch between songs.
